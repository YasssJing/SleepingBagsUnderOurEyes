Runs on my linux (mac) virtual machine
Analyzes a .wav file from within the same directory
  You will need to download one from the sleep slack
It correctly identifies the time sections with an apnea episode
If you can get it to run try to do the rest of the backend stuff
I will be sleeping starting now (6:30am)
You can use python to make an ugly ass GUI which will not run on a phone but on your laptop
